When debugging with gcc, you need to prep the compiled 
program to be gebugged.
Website for reference:

use -g flag like so:
(Replace 'prog' with name of program)

as -g -o prog.o prog.s
gcc -o prog prog.o

To start debugger:
gdb ./prog

start main       	//starts to step into program from main
info registers r1...	//shows data in registers
disassemble		//spits out program in readable text
			//shows what line debugger is on
s			//short for step, performs action in current
			//line and stops at the next line
c			//continues to run program until next breakpoint
			//or error
info b			//list breakpoints
p var			//print contents of var
quit			//self-explanatory
